This article shows how Julia and computer algebra tools classify topological types of real cubic surfaces in projective space. The code extends in the [webisite](https://mathrepo.mis.mpg.de/27pAdicLines/JuliaCode.html) and was developed during an internship at the Institute of Geometry, TU Dresden (June 23 – July 4, 2025).

It includes singularity computation, smoothness checks, and counting connected components, with five examples.

Complete correctness isn’t guaranteed beyond verified linear transformations. Work was done independently using open-source software. The code supports teaching and research.

Thanks to Professor [Mario Kummer](https://tu-dresden.de/mn/math/geometrie/kummer) for his support.
