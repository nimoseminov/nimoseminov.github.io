excerpt: 'This article is intended for my participation in the Jugend Forscht competition next year and is currently not publicly available. The project is still being developed and refined. It has already presented the differential equation systems corresponding to three different cases. In this work, a fundamental theorem from measure theory is employed to improve and modify the classical catenary model by incorporating gravitational potential energy and torsional energy, rather than considering only bending energy.'

This article is intended for my participation in the [Jugend Forscht](https://www.jugend-forscht.de/) competition next year and is currently not publicly available. The project is still being developed and refined. It has already presented the differential equation systems corresponding to three different cases. In this work, a fundamental theorem from measure theory is employed to improve and modify the classical catenary model by incorporating gravitational potential energy and torsional energy, rather than considering only bending energy.
