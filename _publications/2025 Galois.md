This project explores the combination of algebraic geometry and Galois theory to determine the number of connected components of polynomial solution sets. Although the research is still ongoing, several related methods have been introduced. Among them, the necessary and sufficient condition for a polynomial to factor completely into linear equations (hyperplanes) originates from the [reference](https://wenku.csdn.net/doc/7u8353ndrs). The author of that method originally developed it independently without consulting this work, but later acknowledged and cited this project upon discovering it.
